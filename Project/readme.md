## PROBLEMS FACES

## Problem 1: 
Finding Python version compatible with all required libraries.

## Problem 2: 
Sometimes project was taking too much longer in execution, then boom error occurred.

## Problem 4:
Finding solutions for the problems occurring was too much hard, But it wasn't impossible we found solutions of our mysteries on StackOverFlow and on some other platforms.  

## APPROACHES
Approched we used are described below
* KNN
* Linear Regression
* MultinomialNB
* SVM

## DESCRIPTION
Convolutional filters we used are defined below.

* 5X5 Weighted
* 5X5 UnWeighted
* 7X7 Weighted
* 7X7 UnWeighted
* 9X9 Weighted
* 9X9 UnWeighted

We used all the above Filters with all approaches we used,
* KNN
* Linear Regression
* MultinomialNB
* SVM

Results we got by applying filters,
Some random results are defined below,
